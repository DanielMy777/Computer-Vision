## Project 2 - Augmented Reality

Creating an Augmented Reality effect using a simple video. Custom 3D models were designed and added to the video,
making it seem as they are actually there, following the positioning of the camera throughout the video.

Implementation consists of - Image transformation, Feature detection.
